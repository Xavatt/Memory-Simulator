# Memory-Simulator
Second Project of the class (Operating System)


## OBJECTIVE

The goal of this project is to implement a simulator for virtual memory manager. The simulator reads a file with memory references, called a memory trace, and the proceeds to simulate the memory access in a system that consists of a small **Translation LookAhed Buffer (TLB)**. The simulator reports the total number of memory frames used, and the *average access time* for the entire trace.

To verify you read all events in the trace it ir recommended that you also keep tract of the total number of events(memory accesses) in the trace.

## GOALS

The implementation of the cirtual memory simulator will test your comprehension of the interactions between elements in a simple memory hierarchy, as well as verify thta the student is capable of using basic data structures, file management, and general programming methodologies.
